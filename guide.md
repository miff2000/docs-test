## Sub-Category layout

You're welcome to create a new subcategory, for example in relation to a UKFast product or service, or a third party technology where we have some useful guidance or best practise to share.  Where appropriate, please try to structure categories as follows:

1. Include a short introduction (even if just a single sentence) in the catgory `index.rst` file, so readers don't have to click any further to find out what it's about.
2. Then have a "General Information" page.
3. Next, a "Getting Started" guide - this is especially important if talking about a product, whether from UKFast or a third party.
4. You'll probably need a few product or topic-specific pages.
5. Always include a "Troubleshooting" page.  What are the common problems people run into, and how can they be solved?
6. Consider a "Technical information" page if it's likely readers/customers may need detailed technical knowledge of the product
7. Link to ukfast.co.uk, other docs.ukfast pages, and external websites as necessary.  Certainly try not to replicate content already covered on other docs.ukfast pages, just link to the relevant page.

The [FASTcloudbackup category](source/backups/FASTcloudbackup) is a good example of how to structure a category.
